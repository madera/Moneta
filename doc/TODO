TODO:
	* Check for proper const and non const ties, tuples et al.
	* Refactor eager templates in favor of transform_view and other lazy elements.
	* Refactor sepacons in favor of standard fusion fused.
	* On MSVC, definition macros are making Intellisense nauseous.
	* Rethink strategy about to_rtuple functions. Maybe on to_tie variants should exist.
	* Refactor to get more out of the mpl.
	* Add support for multiple index specifications on meta_set components.
	* Create more meta_set tests. Elaborate and stress.
	* Optimize find by member.
	* Review traits collector macros. They are awful right now. Better yet, review member_trait_base.hxx.
	* Review traits::member<> naming.
	* Move has_member_trait.hxx to a proper place.
	* Rethink about test entity names and using their traits in naming. It's a mess right now.

Current Stack:

	* hash_change_tracker
	* Relational context creation (rcontext) using meta_set
	* Entity container search by member
	* Associations
	* Apply associations to relational contexts
	* Reference based entity composition
