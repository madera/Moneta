# Development Log### HistoryWhile developing Moneta, at least three versions have been created. The first one was (until yesterday, February 17th) on github as Moneta, and has been renamed as OldMoneta.Then came a local version, which is being transported to the new and clean Moneta repository, which is the final destination and project home from now on.### Log * The code is being migrated one step at a time into github.com/madera/Moneta. * The Console Shell library has been exported to github.com/madera/console and linked into Moneta as a git submodule.### The Metadata Situation* Entity metadata:	- Member Names [Done]	- Member Pointers [Done]	- Member Pointer Types (return type, parameter types)	- Member Pointer Fingerprints [Done]		- For member ordinals [Done]* Mapping metadata, or Member Annotations  - Based on MemberPointer mappings* API  - User interference point		template <>		struct members_of<Country> {			typedef boost::mpl::vector<				member<Country, int,         &Country::ID  >,				member<Country, std::string, &Country::Name>			> type;		};  - User mapping (or annotation, if you will)	TBD  - Member names OK	const std::vector<std::string>&	moneta::meta::member_names<ET>::get()	Example: { "ID", "Name", "Height" }  - Member types	mpl::vector<...>	type:		moneta::meta::member_types<ET>::type	Example: { int, std::string, double }  - Member type names	const std::vector<std::string>&	moneta::meta::member_type_names<ET>::get()	Example: { "int", "std::string", "double" }  - Member Pointers	fusion::vector<t0, t1, ..., tn>	moneta::meta::member_pointers<ET>::get()	Example: {		member<Person, int,         &Person::ID    >,		member<Person, std::string, &Person::Name  >,		member<Person, double,      &Person::Height>	}  - Member Pointer Types	mpl::vector<t0, t1, ..., tn>	moneta::meta::member_pointer_types<ET>::type	Example: {		int Person::*,		std::string Person::*,		double Person::*	}  - Member Ordinals	template <typename R, class K>	const size_t	moneta::meta::member_ordinal(R K::* memptr);  - Member Pointer Fingerprints  	    moneta::meta::member_pointer_fingerprints<ET>::get()
