    Static Visitor

        PROS
        
        CONS
            
            Method per Message
                One more message means one more method.
                
                Could be separated into hierarchical visitors.
                i.e. handshake, auth, operation, etc.
    
    Dynamic Visitor - Composed at CT using mpl::vector.
    
    
    
    Visitor Hierarchy:
    
        operation_visitor = mpl::vector<
            category_a_visitor,
            category_b_visitor,
            category_x_visitor
        >
    
        mpl::vector<
            handshake_visitor,
            authentication_visitor,
            operation_visitor,
        >
    
    MEQUEDE: container components are having op== troubles.
    
        Maybe have a member op== in meta_set and just delegate to some
        other free function besides op==? There are conflicts...
        
    UPDATE: MEQUEDE: Now we have more stuff... op== was eliminated.
    
        SOLVE THE O(n) WEIRDNESS!!!
        
    Multi-index should be used to its full potential.
    

    Also, review final user API... keep it in mind.
